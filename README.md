# MLP Predicting Bike Share Patterns Project

MLP (Multi-Layer) Perceptron written entirely from scratch and trained to predict bike share patterns throughout the year. Completed as part of Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree.

# Project Overview
The MLP was designed with 3 layers: Input layer, 1 hidden layer, and the output layer with all activation functions realized through a sigmoid function. All math follows traditional matrix multiplication and backward propagation was dervied from partial derivatives with respect to the activation function existent in the neural network.
